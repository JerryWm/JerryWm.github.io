		Only stratum is supported.
		Support for aes ni, soft aes, x86, x64.
		Also assembled xmr-stak racks for different platforms, they are also counted in the test.
		At the first start, testing is started (a simple search of workers).
		During testing, you need to close all applications (close all that you can close, even if the CPU is 0% in the manager), otherwise there is not much point in testing.
